HLS Plugin Phonegap for iOS

We're starting with Jaime's plugin, and completing it so that it works on both iOS and android.
The android component requires the vitamio library, which you have to compile elsewhere (in eclipse, for example)
and then add the jar to the application that you're building.

More information will ensue.
